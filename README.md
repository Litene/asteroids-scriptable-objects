# asteroids-scriptable-objects

Grading Criterias

* To receive a passing grade(G)in the course, students must successfully implement the tool and demonstrate
an understanding of the benefits and limitations of using ScriptableObjectsin Unity projects. 
They must also be able to present and explain their work in a clear and concise manner.  
Aimed to complete  
How: I used Scriptable objects in the project both selfmade and premade. A functional editor window is deployed, found under tools/game editor (in the top)  
scripts: GameCreatorEditor, Asteroid, Hull, Engine  

* Utilize advanced features of Unity editor tools, such as custom inspectors or editors,  
to enhance the user experience and make the tool more powerful and efficient.  
Aimed to complete  
How: I deployed a tool using EditorWindow and UIbuilder to enchance the user experience.   
script: GameCreatorEditor  

* Incorporate error handling, undo/redo functionality, and other best practices to improve the robustness and reliability of the tool.   
Aimed to complete   
How: This was achieved to the dynamic scriptable objects system in the tool, where you save, load or/and create new ones, meaning can load the previous settings,
on more than one object and have multiple versions of your data.   
Scripts: GameCreatorEditor  

* Create additional functionality or expand on the existing functionality to makethe tool more useful and versatile.  
Aimed to complete  
How: Three checks were added to the tool, that I think should be in most tools, which is dev settings for QA and Debuq purposes, I added a cheat mode
which makes you invincible, a hold to shoot button to help if you don't want to spam to shoot and a color to the ship that would help color blind game devs.  
Scripts: GameCreatorEditor, and the actual editor window.   

* Reflect on the process of creating the tool and provide insightful and thoughtful feedback   
on how the use of ScriptableObjectsand Unity editor tools impacted the development process.  
Did not aim to complete  
Why: I chose to focus on the actual implementation and design, rather writing. I do have this insight and have shared it with my classmates   
but I will not focus on writing parts during a vocational education.   
Scripts: none

* Create a well-organized and easy-to-use interface, making sure that all functionalities are intuitive and easy to find.    
Aimed to complete    
How: Probably the best user interface you have seen, the user interface totally speaks for itself, just open the editor window and everything will be clear.  
Scripts: Editor Window   

* Add functionality to the tool which makes it more reusable, like exposing methods or properties to the user that are not hard-coded.    
did not aim to complete  
Why: The restriction of the assignment  
Scripts: None  

* Show evidence of user testing and iteration based on feedback.  
aimed to complete 
How: This is an extremely hard one to proove, but I've walked around the classroom disuccsing and displaying my tool at several occasions.
I hope this is something you saw. The following is three changed made due to feedback, lots more were added due to the fact that I believe that
feedback is vital to the creative process.  
Changes due to feedback:   
1) I was about to make an inspector but Joakim suggested the it would be cleaner and better with a editor window.  
2) Have a set size for the window was suggested by Alice so that the buttons wouldn't jump around when resizing.  
3) Have button for save load funcationality was suggested by Carl to make it more intuitive.  
Scripts: GameCreatorEditor, Editor window 

* Make the tool a Unity package so it can be easily shared with others, document the package and all of its functions in an easy-to-understand way

Why: Time contraints of the assignment  
Scripts: None
